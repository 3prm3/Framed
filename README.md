# HELP! I'm being framed!

HELP! I'm being framed! (or Framed, for short) is a
[Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) mod for the
[Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/) mod loader.
There are no plans for a version for the Forge mod loader.

Framed adds several types of block frame with various shapes. Each
frame can have its texture changed to that of any full-size block in
the game. While flowers, slabs, and similar items, are able to be
placed into the world, they are not able to be placed into a frame.

[![Requires Fabric API](assets/fabric_api_banner.png)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)

Framed depends on [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api),
[LibGui](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/libgui),
[JMX](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jmx), and
[FREX](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/frex), but you only need to install 
[Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)!

## Download

Framed is not currently available, but when it is, it will be available through
its [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/framed) and
[CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/framed) pages.

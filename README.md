# Framity

Framity is a [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) mod for the [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/) mod loader.
There are no plans for a version for the Forge mod loader.

Framity adds several types of block frame with various shapes. Each
frame can have its texture changed to that of any full-size block in
the game. While flowers, slabs, and similar items, are able to be
placed into the world, they are not able to be placed into a frame.

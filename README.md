# Framity

Framity is a [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) mod for the [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/) mod loader.
There are no plans for a version for the Forge mod loader.

Framity adds several types of block frame with various shapes. Each
frame can have its texture changed to that of any full-size block in
the game. While flowers, slabs, and similar items, are able to be
placed into the world, they are not able to be placed into a frame.

incredible help and support throughout the creation of Framity.
- [Grondag](https://www.curseforge.com/members/grondagthebarbarian)
for immensely helping me understand the fabric rendering API.
- [LibGui](https://github.com/CottonMC/LibGui) for making GUI creation so easy.

me use assets from the original
